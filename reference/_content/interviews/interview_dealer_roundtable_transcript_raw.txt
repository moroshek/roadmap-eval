Dealer Roundtable - Raw Transcript Excerpt

Moderator: Let's start simple, where are you losing the most time?
Dealer Principal 1: Honestly? Chasing answers. Not fixing cars, chasing answers. Service advisors open tickets, then wait. Customers think we're stalling, but we're waiting on approvals or parts ETAs that move every day.
Dealer Principal 2: And incentives. We announce a campaign, the portal updates late, then sales teams quote one number and finance sees another. By the time we reconcile it, social media has screenshots and now we're defending credibility.
Moderator: If you could change one thing this quarter?
Service Director: One source of truth for claim status. I don't care if the backend is five systems, but the front should act like one system.
Dealer Ops Lead: Plus alerting that is human-readable. Not "error code 7612." Tell me "photo missing for claim line item 3" so my team can fix it in 30 seconds.

[side conversation, partially captured]
Dealer Principal 3: We also need better weekend escalation. Friday afternoon issues basically vanish until Monday unless someone has a personal contact.
Service Director: Exactly. Then Monday we get a wall of aged tickets and everyone is already defensive.
Dealer Principal 1: Customers do not care which team owns which queue. They just see delay.

Moderator: How do you feel about current digital roadmap priorities?
Dealer Ops Lead: Mixed. Some improvements are nice but cosmetic. We keep adding interface polish while core status plumbing is still brittle.
Dealer Principal 2: I loved the faster search last release, that helped, but if approvals still bounce back for undocumented reasons then we just find bad news faster.
Service Director: That's the phrase of the day: "faster bad news."

Moderator: Last question, what would make you feel heard?
Dealer Principal 3: Publish a monthly "you said / we changed" note. Doesn't have to be perfect, just show that feedback turns into backlog decisions.
Dealer Principal 1: And don't wait for annual conferences. Half these fixes are workflow details we can validate in a 20-minute pilot.
