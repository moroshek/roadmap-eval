    "top_strengths": [
      "Exemplary data pipeline architecture: full-stack separation with Django backend services (content_loader → matrix → governance) feeding a pure React presentation layer. The chart component receives fully prepared data and only handles rendering.",
      "Premium scatter plot implementation: quadrant background zones with distinct colors, labeled axes, data points sized by cost and colored by quadrant, brush-to-zoom interaction — goes well beyond minimum requirements.",
      "Impressive feature coverage: shipped a complete strategic planning tool (dashboard, matrix, Gantt, project library, project detail, search) with consistent quality in a 3-hour timebox. Demonstrates strong product thinking.",
      "Perfect PRD compliance on core logic: quadrant boundaries, axis orientation, normalization math all exactly correct. Additional PRD details implemented (cmd+k search, sidebar structure, print styles)."
    ],
    "top_weaknesses": [
      "Fixed sidebar breaks mobile layouts: w-64 sidebar with ml-64 content margin means the app is unusable on mobile viewports. No responsive collapse mechanism.",
      "Sparse git history: all work in a single monolithic commit (5729 insertions). No incremental progress visible, making it impossible to understand the development approach.",
      "DRF serializers defined but never called: backend/api/serializers.py has comprehensive validation rules (score ranges, date ordering, status constraints) but views.py never invokes them — the validation is dead code.",
      "No runtime data validation on frontend: API responses are trusted without verification. Content loader has no error handling for malformed markdown files."
    ],
    "standout_moments": [
      "Built a full Django+DRF backend from scratch alongside the Next.js frontend — an ambitious full-stack architecture choice for a 3-hour assessment. The backend services (content_loader, matrix, governance) are well-structured.",
      "Implemented brush-to-zoom on the scatter plot chart — a sophisticated interaction that goes well beyond the requirements.",
      "Gantt chart timeline view with today-line indicator, status-colored bars, and group-by toggle — impressive bonus feature with real data."
    ],
    "hiring_signal": "This is a productive full-stack developer who can ship a polished, coherent product under time pressure. They demonstrate strong architectural instincts (clean service layer, proper separation) and product thinking (chose features that make a usable tool). Key risk areas are mobile/responsive design and defensive coding practices (validation gaps). Would thrive in a role where shipping complete features quickly is valued.",
