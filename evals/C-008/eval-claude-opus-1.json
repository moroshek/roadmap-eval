      "Correct matrix logic: normalization (×10 with clamping) and quadrant assignment are accurate for all four quadrants with proper boundary handling at 50 (src/lib/matrix.ts).",
      "Clean separation of concerns: data loading (loadProjects.ts), transformation (matrix.ts), and presentation (StrategyMatrix.tsx) are properly separated into dedicated files with one-directional dependency flow.",
      "Chart visualization includes colored quadrant zones, text labels, dashed reference lines, labeled axes with correct domain (0-100), and custom tooltips — showing care for the core deliverable.",
      "Added 3 additional project files (PRJ-005 through PRJ-007) with realistic data spanning different quadrants, departments, and phases."
    ],
    "top_weaknesses": [
      "Critical cross-platform bug: file at src/Components/ (uppercase) but imported as @/components/ (lowercase), causing both build failure and dev-mode 500 error on case-sensitive filesystems (Linux). The deliverable does not run on our test environment.",
      "No features beyond the matrix: no dashboard, no additional pages, no navigation, no search/filtering. The application is a single page with a chart.",
      "Minimal UI polish: inline styles only, no CSS framework, no design tokens from config.json, no loading/error states. The page looks like a bare prototype.",
      "Missing .gitignore, TypeScript strict mode off, no linting — project configuration gaps that suggest limited experience with production-quality project setup."
    ],
    "standout_moments": [
      "The defensive coding in normalizeScore (typeof check + clamping) and transformToMatrix (null coalescing defaults) shows thoughtfulness about data quality, even though broader error handling is missing.",
      "The candidate's Summary.md is candid about what was and wasn't accomplished, including a personal note about enjoying the challenge."
    ],
    "hiring_signal": "This candidate demonstrates understanding of core programming concepts — they correctly implemented data transformation logic with proper separation of concerns. However, the delivery is minimal (single feature, no polish, broken build) and the cross-platform bug suggests limited experience with CI/CD or multi-environment testing. This profile suggests a junior developer who can implement specified logic but needs mentorship on project setup, testing discipline, and end-to-end delivery.",
