      "Design tokens from config.json (primary/secondary/accent colors, Inter/Roboto fonts) are defined but not consumed by the UI — hardcoded Tailwind classes used instead, no CSS variables or theme provider, no font configuration (tailwind.config.ts has empty theme.extend)",
      "Navigation header is not responsive — 4 links plus GlobalSearch in a flex row with gap-6 will overflow on mobile screens, with no hamburger menu, no flex-wrap, and no responsive hiding (AppHeader.tsx:14-50)",
      "Quadrant overlay background zones don't precisely align with chart data area due to Recharts chart margins (50% CSS positioning on container vs chart margins top:20, right:20, bottom:60, left:60), potentially misleading users about data point quadrant membership",
      "Design-token integration is weak at runtime: tenant branding exists in `_content/config.json`, but UI styling remains largely hardcoded in component files (e.g., `src/components/matrix/MatrixChart.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`).",
      "Matrix dataset is limited to the seeded 4 projects only, which caps demonstration of broader data modeling and realism for A1.",

      "Lack of Dynamic Theming: Design tokens were hardcoded into components rather than using a dynamic system.",

      "This developer demonstrates strong architectural thinking and understanding of production-quality patterns (Zod validation pipelines, pure function separation, comprehensive error handling). The submission shows someone who can leverage AI tools effectively to produce a polished, feature-rich application with good code quality and testing discipline. However, the heavy reliance on AI scaffolding (extensive planning documents, agent handoffs) and time overrun (215 vs 180 minutes) raise questions about independent velocity and time management under constraints. Would thrive in a role where systematic architecture, thorough documentation, and AI-augmented development are valued.",
      "This is a high-functioning product-minded frontend/full-stack candidate with strong implementation rigor on core requirements and thoughtful bonus expansion. They show strong architecture instincts, testing discipline, and delivery execution. The main development area is making white-label theming truly config-driven instead of largely static styling.",
      "Highly disciplined, senior-level developer with strong architectural thinking and exceptional documentation habits. A 'force multiplier' who builds robust, well-tested systems. Delivers high-quality code at significant velocity."
