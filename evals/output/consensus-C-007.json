    "all_strengths": [
      "Exemplary data pipeline architecture: full-stack separation with Django backend services (content_loader → matrix → governance) feeding a pure React presentation layer. The chart component receives fully prepared data and only handles rendering.",
      "Premium scatter plot implementation: quadrant background zones with distinct colors, labeled axes, data points sized by cost and colored by quadrant, brush-to-zoom interaction — goes well beyond minimum requirements.",
      "Impressive feature coverage: shipped a complete strategic planning tool (dashboard, matrix, Gantt, project library, project detail, search) with consistent quality in a 3-hour timebox. Demonstrates strong product thinking.",
      "Perfect PRD compliance on core logic: quadrant boundaries, axis orientation, normalization math all exactly correct. Additional PRD details implemented (cmd+k search, sidebar structure, print styles).",
      "Excellent PRD fidelity on matrix semantics and rendering, including correct axis orientation and top-left Quick Wins (`src/components/matrix/StrategyMatrix.tsx:374`, `src/components/matrix/StrategyMatrix.tsx:266`, `backend/api/services/matrix.py:8`).",
      "Strong full-stack decomposition with dedicated backend services and clean frontend route/component structure (`backend/api/services/content_loader.py:12`, `backend/api/services/matrix.py:26`, `src/app/layout.tsx:14`).",
      "High-value bonus scope delivered: dashboard metrics, roadmap timeline, global fuzzy search, and advanced matrix interactions (`src/app/page.tsx:25`, `src/app/roadmap/page.tsx:150`, `src/components/layout/TopBar.tsx:85`, `src/components/matrix/StrategyMatrix.tsx:357`).",
      "Architecture: Clean full-stack separation with a Python backend and Next.js frontend.",

    "all_weaknesses": [
      "Fixed sidebar breaks mobile layouts: w-64 sidebar with ml-64 content margin means the app is unusable on mobile viewports. No responsive collapse mechanism.",
      "Sparse git history: all work in a single monolithic commit (5729 insertions). No incremental progress visible, making it impossible to understand the development approach.",
      "DRF serializers defined but never called: backend/api/serializers.py has comprehensive validation rules (score ranges, date ordering, status constraints) but views.py never invokes them — the validation is dead code.",
      "No runtime data validation on frontend: API responses are trusted without verification. Content loader has no error handling for malformed markdown files.",
      "Tenant design tokens are not dynamically consumed from config, limiting true white-label behavior (`src/app/globals.css:4` vs token source in `_content/config.json`).",
      "Runtime robustness has gaps where errors are swallowed or not validated at load boundaries (`src/components/layout/TopBar.tsx:56`, `backend/api/services/content_loader.py:21`).",
      "Git history is too sparse to demonstrate incremental delivery discipline (2 commits total).",

      "Built a full Django+DRF backend from scratch alongside the Next.js frontend — an ambitious full-stack architecture choice for a 3-hour assessment. The backend services (content_loader, matrix, governance) are well-structured.",
      "Implemented brush-to-zoom on the scatter plot chart — a sophisticated interaction that goes well beyond the requirements.",
      "Gantt chart timeline view with today-line indicator, status-colored bars, and group-by toggle — impressive bonus feature with real data.",
      "Matrix implementation includes polished quadrant zoning and brush-to-zoom interactions uncommon for time-boxed submissions.",
      "Candidate shipped a coherent backend API and frontend experience rather than a matrix-only implementation.",
      "The custom zoom logic on the Strategy Matrix chart is highly impressive and adds significant value for users with many data points.",
      "The use of a backend service for temporal logic (auto-updating project statuses based on date) shows production-level thinking."

      "This is a productive full-stack developer who can ship a polished, coherent product under time pressure. They demonstrate strong architectural instincts (clean service layer, proper separation) and product thinking (chose features that make a usable tool). Key risk areas are mobile/responsive design and defensive coding practices (validation gaps). Would thrive in a role where shipping complete features quickly is valued.",
      "This submission demonstrates a practical full-stack developer who can implement critical product logic correctly and extend into meaningful user-facing features under time constraints. The strongest signals are matrix correctness, thoughtful interaction design, and delivery breadth. Main risks are production-hardening depth (runtime validation/error pathways) and limited evidence of iterative git workflow.",
      "This is a top-tier candidate who demonstrates both technical depth and product intuition. They are capable of architecting complex systems while maintaining a high level of UI polish and attention to detail. Risks are minimal."
