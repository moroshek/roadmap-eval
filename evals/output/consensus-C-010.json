      "Perfect PRD compliance (100%): Every specification detail implemented correctly — quadrant logic, axis orientation, build-time validation rules (ID uniqueness, date validity, referential integrity, taxonomy checks), module toggles, cmd+k search with exact Fuse.js weights, print styles. The candidate clearly read and internalized the entire PRD.",
      "Exemplary data pipeline architecture: Clean separation from markdown parsing (gray-matter) → Zod validation → normalization/quadrant assignment (dedicated utilities) → React Context → pure presentation components. The chart component receives fully prepared data and contains zero transformation logic.",
      "Comprehensive feature coverage: 6 routes with purpose-built content (Dashboard, Matrix, Gantt, Project Library, Project Detail, Updates), each with real computed data. The features form a coherent product — a usable strategic planning tool, not just isolated widgets.",
      "Professional-grade design token system: All brand colors, typography, and theming driven from config.json via Tailwind theme extension. Zero hardcoded brand values. True white-label architecture — swap config.json to re-theme for any tenant.",
      "Exceptional PR documentation: Structured, comprehensive PR description covering must-have implementation, bonus features, PRD compliance details, architecture decisions, and a test plan. PLAN.md adds phased implementation context.",
      "High-quality end-to-end product implementation with all primary PRD routes and cohesive navigation, not just the must-have matrix (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/app/*`, `candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/components/Sidebar.tsx:14-67`).",
      "Strong data architecture with schema validation, build-time integrity checks, enrichment, and centralized master-data delivery (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/lib/content.ts:49-230`, `candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/lib/schemas.ts:26-83`).",
      "Matrix implementation is both correct and polished, including quadrant zones, filtering, zoom interactions, and rich tooltips (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/components/StrategyMatrix.tsx:117-123`, `candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/components/StrategyMatrix.tsx:335-471`).",
      "UX polish is consistently strong with skeleton loading, responsive behavior, keyboard search, and print-ready detail pages (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/app/loading.tsx:6-22`, `candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/components/SearchModal.tsx:60-111`, `candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/app/globals.css:62-125`).",

    "all_weaknesses": [
      "Large component files without sub-component extraction: ProjectLibrary.tsx (623 lines) contains ProjectCard, ProjectRow, ProgressBar, and RangeSlider sub-components that should be separate files for maintainability.",
      "No React error boundaries: Runtime UI failures would show raw errors to users. Build-time validation is thorough but no graceful degradation layer exists for unexpected runtime conditions.",
      "Types defined separately from Zod schemas: src/lib/types.ts manually defines interfaces rather than using z.infer<typeof Schema>, creating a maintenance risk where schema and type definitions could drift.",
      "Git history shows a single massive commit followed by refinement passes rather than truly incremental development progression. The initial implementation commit contains ~90% of the work.",
      "Submission documentation is not fully final-form: there is a detailed plan but no concise final summary of tradeoffs/known limitations for reviewers (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/PLAN.md:85-88`).",
      "No dedicated app-level error boundary route (`src/app/error.tsx`) was found, which limits resilience for unexpected runtime rendering failures.",
      "Design token theming is strong but primarily build-time; tenant typography runtime flexibility is limited by fixed font imports in layout (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/app/layout.tsx:2-19`).",
      "None identified within the scope of this assessment."

      "Custom Gantt chart built from scratch (not a library) with horizontal timeline bars, status coloring, today marker, milestone diamonds, grouping dropdown, and responsive month labels with smart thinning — all in 256 lines.",
      "Ingestion pipeline (scripts/ingest.mjs) that processes interview transcripts into structured draft project files using heuristic NLP. While not AI-powered, it demonstrates product thinking about the full data lifecycle and provides a clear integration point for future LLM enhancement.",
      "10 project files spanning all quadrants, departments, phases, and statuses — with inter-project dependencies forming a realistic portfolio graph. PRJ-006 is marked Complete with [x] deliverables. This content richness makes every page feel like a real product.",
      "The candidate delivered a coherent product suite (dashboard + matrix + roadmap + project detail + updates + global search) rather than isolated feature demos.",
      "Matrix interactions include brush-to-zoom and filter side panel, which materially improves exploratory usability for roadmap planning.",
      "Commit history shows active iteration against PRD audit gaps (validation, accessibility, responsiveness, and chart correctness) within the time window.",
      "The brush-to-zoom implementation on the Strategy Matrix was a delightful surprise that demonstrates deep control over the charting library.",
      "The build-time validation logic in content.ts is exceptionally thorough, even checking referential integrity and taxonomy compliance."

    "hiring_signals": [
      "This is a strong full-stack developer with excellent product sensibility and spec-reading discipline. They prioritized correctly (must-have first, then systematic bonus features), made expert dependency choices aligned with PRD recommendations, and built a cohesive product rather than isolated components. Their architecture demonstrates senior-level thinking — the data pipeline, design token system, and separation of concerns are all production-grade patterns. The main risk is a tendency toward large single-commit implementations rather than incremental delivery, which could be a concern in team-based workflows requiring frequent code review.",
      "This is a high-performing full-stack implementation with strong product execution instincts and solid architectural judgment. The candidate reliably shipped the must-have and translated remaining time into meaningful, integrated capabilities instead of superficial add-ons. Main risk is communication maturity around final handoff docs and a few production-hardening details, not core engineering ability.",
      "Moroshko is a top-tier full-stack developer who combines deep technical skill with strong product thinking. They shipped more high-quality features in 3 hours than most candidates ship in 10. They are a 'Strong Hire' for any senior role."
