    "all_strengths": [
      "Correct matrix logic: normalization (×10 with clamping) and quadrant assignment are accurate for all four quadrants with proper boundary handling at 50 (src/lib/matrix.ts).",
      "Clean separation of concerns: data loading (loadProjects.ts), transformation (matrix.ts), and presentation (StrategyMatrix.tsx) are properly separated into dedicated files with one-directional dependency flow.",
      "Chart visualization includes colored quadrant zones, text labels, dashed reference lines, labeled axes with correct domain (0-100), and custom tooltips — showing care for the core deliverable.",
      "Added 3 additional project files (PRJ-005 through PRJ-007) with realistic data spanning different quadrants, departments, and phases.",
      "Strong matrix transformation pipeline with dedicated normalization and quadrant logic utilities (`src/lib/matrix.ts:2-50`).",
      "Scatter matrix visualization includes properly oriented axes, quadrant shading/labels, and useful tooltip content (`src/Components/StrategyMatrix.tsx:53-87`).",
      "Candidate expanded dataset to seven projects across varied departments and score ranges (`_content/projects/PRJ-001.md:2`, `_content/projects/PRJ-007.md:2`).",
      "Excellent data transformation logic in matrix.ts with perfect PRD adherence.",

      "Critical cross-platform bug: file at src/Components/ (uppercase) but imported as @/components/ (lowercase), causing both build failure and dev-mode 500 error on case-sensitive filesystems (Linux). The deliverable does not run on our test environment.",
      "No features beyond the matrix: no dashboard, no additional pages, no navigation, no search/filtering. The application is a single page with a chart.",
      "Minimal UI polish: inline styles only, no CSS framework, no design tokens from config.json, no loading/error states. The page looks like a bare prototype.",
      "Missing .gitignore, TypeScript strict mode off, no linting — project configuration gaps that suggest limited experience with production-quality project setup.",
      "Production build fails due import path/case mismatch (`src/app/matrix/page.tsx:3` vs `src/Components/StrategyMatrix.tsx`).",
      "PRD route scope is largely unimplemented: only `/matrix` route exists in `src/app`.",
      "No design-token integration from tenant config; colors are hardcoded instead (`_content/config.json:8-18`, `src/Components/StrategyMatrix.tsx:55-58`).",
      "Fragile build configuration (case-sensitivity issue) that breaks on Linux.",
      "Extremely limited scope (only /matrix route implemented).",
      "Ignored design tokens and global configuration requirements."
    ],
    "all_standout_moments": [
      "The defensive coding in normalizeScore (typeof check + clamping) and transformToMatrix (null coalescing defaults) shows thoughtfulness about data quality, even though broader error handling is missing.",
      "The candidate's Summary.md is candid about what was and wasn't accomplished, including a personal note about enjoying the challenge.",
      "Quadrant compliance is notably strong: logic boundaries and visual placement match PRD expectations.",
      "The quadrant background shading and labels in the scatter plot are very well done."
    ],
    "hiring_signals": [
      "This candidate demonstrates understanding of core programming concepts — they correctly implemented data transformation logic with proper separation of concerns. However, the delivery is minimal (single feature, no polish, broken build) and the cross-platform bug suggests limited experience with CI/CD or multi-environment testing. This profile suggests a junior developer who can implement specified logic but needs mentorship on project setup, testing discipline, and end-to-end delivery.",
      "This submission shows the candidate can implement core data-to-visualization logic quickly and structure matrix-specific code reasonably well. The main risk is delivery reliability: a straightforward path/case import issue leaves the production build broken, and overall feature coverage is narrow. Best fit appears to be a junior-to-mid role with stronger release/checklist rigor and broader product-scope execution needed.",
      "This candidate is a strong 'logic and data' developer but lacks the holistic 'product' focus required for a senior role. They write very clean, maintainable code for specific features but struggle with cross-platform build considerations and broader application architecture. They would thrive in a backend-leaning frontend role or as part of a team where a senior developer provides the architectural scaffolding."
