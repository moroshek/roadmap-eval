      "Impressive feature velocity: built a functional dashboard with calculated metrics, Gantt chart timeline with grouping, searchable project library, and an updates feed — all with real data — beyond the core requirement, in a 3-hour assessment.",
      "Professional visual design: consistent use of AutoNova design tokens (config.json colors and typography), glass morphism effects, gradient text, hover animations, and a fully responsive sidebar navigation create a polished SaaS aesthetic.",
      "Correct PRD compliance: all 4 projects correctly normalized (×10) and assigned to the right quadrants with proper axis orientation (X=Effort, Y=Impact). Quadrant boundaries match PRD Section 2.1 exactly.",
      "Core matrix pipeline is correctly implemented end-to-end (markdown -> normalization -> quadrant assignment -> scatter render) with clean separation across src/lib/data.ts, src/app/api/matrix/route.ts, and src/components/StrategyMatrix.tsx.",
      "UI polish is above baseline: consistent visual language, responsive sidebar navigation, and high-quality dashboard/card presentation across main routes.",
      "Implemented meaningful bonus scope beyond the must-have, including a functional roadmap timeline and project library with filtering.",
      "Exceptional visual design and polish, giving the app a professional SaaS feel.",
      "Comprehensive bonus features, specifically the Gantt chart and Executive Dashboard.",
      "Clean, well-structured data layer and architecture.",
      "Exceptional communication of architectural decisions and trade-offs."

    "all_weaknesses": [
      "Documentation lacks self-awareness of gaps — three detailed markdown files cover what was built but don't acknowledge missing features (/projects/[slug]) or technical limitations (no runtime validation, unsafe type casts).",
      "Single implementation commit (all work in one commit) provides no visibility into development process, decision-making progression, or incremental thinking.",
      "No runtime validation: gray-matter output is unsafely cast as ProjectData (data.ts:33); malformed frontmatter would cause runtime errors downstream. No Zod/Yup schema validation despite TypeScript interfaces being well-defined.",
      "Basic search implementation: uses .includes() string matching (projects/page.tsx:43-47) instead of fuzzy search (Fuse.js per PRD Section 7.1), limiting the search experience on the projects page.",
      "PRD route coverage is incomplete because /projects/[slug] is missing (src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx absent).",
      "Validation and governance robustness are limited: no Zod/build-time schema validation, and malformed frontmatter handling is minimal.",
      "Tooling completeness is partial: npm run lint is currently interactive (ESLint not configured), which weakens CI readiness.",
      "Sparse git history (only two commits).",
      "Lack of fuzzy search implementation.",
      "Lack of runtime schema validation for parsed project data."

      "The Gantt chart implementation (GanttChart.tsx, 220 lines) is a fully functional timeline visualization with month grid, today marker, status color coding, department/status grouping, and hover tooltips — a significant bonus feature showing strong product thinking and execution speed.",
      "The updates feed (updates/page.tsx) generates intelligent activity insights from project data, including risk alerts based on complexity/confidence thresholds (line 122: complexity > 7 && confidence < 0.8) — creative and domain-aware beyond explicit requirements.",
      "The matrix visualization quality is notably strong for a timed submission, including quadrant background labeling and rich tooltips.",
      "The custom Gantt chart implementation in components/GanttChart.tsx is a high-effort addition that works perfectly with the project data."

    "hiring_signals": [
      "This developer demonstrates strong product instincts and can ship a polished, feature-rich application quickly. They prioritized the core requirement correctly, then strategically chose high-impact bonus features that create a cohesive tool. Gaps in type safety (unsafe casts) and runtime validation suggest someone who moves fast but may need coaching on engineering rigor and defensive coding practices.",
      "This submission shows a developer who can ship a polished, working product slice quickly and make pragmatic architecture choices. The candidate is strongest in UI delivery and feature integration, with moderate gaps in production hardening (validation, CI lint discipline, and full PRD completeness).",
      "Afham is a highly skilled developer with a strong eye for both architecture and UI/UX. They delivered a polished product that exceeds requirements with premium quality."
