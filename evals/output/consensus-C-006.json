      "Outstanding submission documentation — PR description is structured, explains decisions and trade-offs, and documents verification approach. Demonstrates strong communication skills.",
      "Expert dependency choices — recharts, Fuse.js, Zod, gray-matter all align with PRD recommendations. No unnecessary dependencies.",
      "Strong matrix implementation quality: accurate normalization/quadrant logic and polished scatter visualization (`src/lib/projects.ts:68-92`, `src/components/StrategyMatrix.tsx:183-245`).",

      "Minor type safety gaps — two any usages: ProjectTable.tsx:44 (sort comparator) and projects/[slug]/page.tsx:183 ((project as any).tags). The tags comment (lines 174-181) reveals awareness of the issue but it wasn't resolved.",
      "No React error boundaries — while individual error handling is decent (Zod validation, notFound(), optional chaining), there are no error boundaries to catch rendering failures. A malformed project could potentially crash the entire application.",
      "Filter logic mixed with presentation — StrategyMatrix.tsx contains both filter state management (department/phase/quadrant filters) and chart rendering. Extracting to a custom hook would improve separation of concerns.",

      "This is a high-velocity full-stack developer with strong product sensibility and communication skills. They prioritize well (core requirement first, then strategic bonus features), write clean TypeScript with proper validation, and produce polished UIs that look production-ready. The main risk is a tendency toward breadth over depth — the 38 projects and 5 routes show impressive ambition, but some corners were cut on error handling and design system integration. Best suited for a product-focused engineering role where velocity and user-facing quality matter more than deep systems engineering.",
      "This submission demonstrates a strong product-oriented full-stack/frontend developer who can deliver the core requirement correctly and then expand scope with useful, coherent features. They show good implementation velocity and practical engineering judgment. Primary risk areas are deeper config-driven architecture discipline and tightening type/runtime rigor at edges.",
      "Ajayd7 is a top-tier full-stack developer who can ship polished, complex features with high velocity and technical rigor. They demonstrate excellent architectural thinking and attention to spec details. While they missed some configuration-driven theming requirements, their ability to deliver a nearly complete product-grade experience in a short window is remarkable."
