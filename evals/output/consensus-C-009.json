    "all_standout_moments": [
      "The irony of this submission is notable: the candidate built a substantial, functional project management application with CRUD, a dashboard, a roadmap view, and a backend API — but completely ignored the one feature that was marked as an automatic failure condition. The quality of the bonus work makes the missing must-have even more puzzling.",
      "PRJ-005 ('absd' by 'gjkbjk') appears to be a test artifact from the CRUD feature, and its malformed data (missing dates) is what crashes the production build. This illustrates the risk of not validating data.",
      "The candidate built a full backend system within the time limit, which is impressive but ultimately led to failure on the core task."
    ],
    "hiring_signals": [
      "This candidate demonstrates ability to build functional full-stack features (CRUD, API, dashboard) but exhibited a critical failure in reading and prioritizing requirements. They built around the core requirement rather than through it, suggesting either they didn't read the assessment brief carefully, didn't understand the scatter plot requirement, or lacked confidence with data visualization. The technical work that exists is competent but not exceptional — basic Tailwind UI, standard Express patterns, no TypeScript. This profile carries significant risk: the ability to ship features is there, but the judgment to ship the right features is not.",
      "This candidate appears to be a capable full-stack developer who enjoys building systems and infrastructure but struggles with prioritization and following specific product requirements. They would likely thrive in a role focused on internal tools or backend services but are currently a risk for product-focused roles requiring strict adherence to specs."
