    "top_strengths": [
      "High-quality end-to-end product implementation with all primary PRD routes and cohesive navigation, not just the must-have matrix (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/app/*`, `candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/components/Sidebar.tsx:14-67`).",
      "Strong data architecture with schema validation, build-time integrity checks, enrichment, and centralized master-data delivery (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/lib/content.ts:49-230`, `candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/lib/schemas.ts:26-83`).",
      "Matrix implementation is both correct and polished, including quadrant zones, filtering, zoom interactions, and rich tooltips (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/components/StrategyMatrix.tsx:117-123`, `candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/components/StrategyMatrix.tsx:335-471`).",
      "UX polish is consistently strong with skeleton loading, responsive behavior, keyboard search, and print-ready detail pages (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/app/loading.tsx:6-22`, `candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/components/SearchModal.tsx:60-111`, `candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/app/globals.css:62-125`)."

    "top_weaknesses": [
      "Submission documentation is not fully final-form: there is a detailed plan but no concise final summary of tradeoffs/known limitations for reviewers (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/PLAN.md:85-88`).",
      "No dedicated app-level error boundary route (`src/app/error.tsx`) was found, which limits resilience for unexpected runtime rendering failures.",
      "Design token theming is strong but primarily build-time; tenant typography runtime flexibility is limited by fixed font imports in layout (`candidates/roadmap-Moroshko/src/app/layout.tsx:2-19`)."
    ],
    "standout_moments": [
      "The candidate delivered a coherent product suite (dashboard + matrix + roadmap + project detail + updates + global search) rather than isolated feature demos.",
      "Matrix interactions include brush-to-zoom and filter side panel, which materially improves exploratory usability for roadmap planning.",
      "Commit history shows active iteration against PRD audit gaps (validation, accessibility, responsiveness, and chart correctness) within the time window."
    ],
    "hiring_signal": "This is a high-performing full-stack implementation with strong product execution instincts and solid architectural judgment. The candidate reliably shipped the must-have and translated remaining time into meaningful, integrated capabilities instead of superficial add-ons. Main risk is communication maturity around final handoff docs and a few production-hardening details, not core engineering ability.",
    "recommendation": "Strong Hire"
