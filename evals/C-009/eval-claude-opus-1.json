    "hiring_signal": "This candidate demonstrates ability to build functional full-stack features (CRUD, API, dashboard) but exhibited a critical failure in reading and prioritizing requirements. They built around the core requirement rather than through it, suggesting either they didn't read the assessment brief carefully, didn't understand the scatter plot requirement, or lacked confidence with data visualization. The technical work that exists is competent but not exceptional — basic Tailwind UI, standard Express patterns, no TypeScript. This profile carries significant risk: the ability to ship features is there, but the judgment to ship the right features is not.",
